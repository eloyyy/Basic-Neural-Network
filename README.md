# Basic-Neural-Network
Python script that builds, trains a basic neural network and plots the classifier for a simulated binary classification problem.
The structure of the neural network (number of neurons per layer) can be specified by the user directly by typing a list on the command line.
The network is trained with a simple gradient descent which has been coded from scratch so as to clearly understand how it works.
